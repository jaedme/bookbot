# BookBot

BookBot is my first project!

BookBot is a command-line application built in Python that performs static analysis on text files, allowing users to analyze entire novels, such as "Frankenstein". This project is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming and software development practices.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: Analyze text files for various metrics such as word count, sentence length, and readability scores.
- **File Support**: Works with plain text files, making it easy to analyze any novel or text document.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple and intuitive CLI for easy interaction with the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaedme/bookbot.git
   cd bookbot
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To analyze a text file, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python bookbot.py path/to/your/textfile.txt
```

Replace `path/to/your/textfile.txt` with the path to the text file you want to analyze.
